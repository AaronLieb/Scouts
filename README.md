# Scouts

## Materials

1. A 8x10 board
2. five red pieces with a symbol on one side (red scouts) 
3. five blue pieces with a symbol on one side (blue scouts)
4. two 2x2 pieces (boulders)

## Setup

The game is played with the 8 long side facing the opponents.

1. Flip a coin to decide who starts first
2. Player one starts by placing a scout anywhere on their back rank
3. The players alternate and repeat this process until they are out of scouts

## Taking a turn

Typically a turn consists of 2 "plays". A "play" starts with a scout making one of two moves: a "jump" or a "dash".

You cannot use your second "play" on the same scout as the first play. And you cannot split your moves between plays. You must first play all of your moves on one scout, then play all of your moves on a different scout.

### Jumping
 A "jump" involves jumping over another scout in one of the 4 cardinal directions.
```
...
xo.
...
```

*x jumps over o to the right*

```
...
.ox
...
```

A jump cannot be made without another piece adjacent to jump over.
If another piece blocks the landing spot of the jump, the jump cannot be made.

After jumping, a scout may (optionally) choose to "dash", or, if possible,  "jump" again.
A "play" can be made up of multiple moves by jumping multiple times.

### Dashing

A dash involves moving the scout in one of 8 directions (adjacent + diagonal). 
You cannot dash a scout to a space that is already occupied.

A scout cannot make any additional moves after dashing in a play.

## Starting the game

Typically, most moves consist of 2 plays. On the first move of the game however, player 1 only gets 1 play. This is to prevent player 1 from having a significant advantage for starting first.

## Launching Boulders

Each player starts with one 2x2 boulder. Whenever it is your turn, you may use one "play" to instead launch a boulder. 

Boulders can be placed in any spot that doesn't have any pieces in the 2x2 area.

## Win Condition

Once a scout reaches the enemy's back rank, you flip the scout, symbolizing that they have gathered important intel.
Multiple scouts can be flipped.
If a flipped scout reaches their original back rank, that player wins the game.
